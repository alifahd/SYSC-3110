Changes:
	- User can save a game to a file while playing
	- User can load a saved game before starting a game
	- User can select a custom map before starting a game
	
Issues:
	- The executable jar file for some does not open the game due to the Image reader. 
	If it does does open up, the map might be a little bigger and you need to fullscreen to see the bottom panel.
	The program works as it should if ran in IntelliJ
	- When a dialog box with user input appears, if the user closes the box, the game does not function anymore
